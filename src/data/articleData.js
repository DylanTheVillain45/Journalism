    The College Dropout , released by Kanye West under Def Jam Records on February 10th, 2004, is West's freshman album.
    
    With a runtime of 1 hour and 16 minutes, 13 performance features, and all-original "producer rapping," The College Dropout encapsulates the story of West's early rise to fame, his relationships with others in Chi-town, and thanks and tributes to those who've helped him grow.
    
    Having started producing in the mid 90's, West began building his career producing for local Chicago artists, and eventually worked his way up to labels, eventually being one of the main producers behind Jay-Z's The Blueprint, released in 2001. However, West wanted his career to be more than just producing, evident from his numerous attempts to show his skills off to major artists (which West himself talks about on Last Call, the album closer.) However, major labels believed that West didn't fit the image of what Hip-Hop represented at the time.
    
    But that didn't stop West from being sought after by artists. After his success working on The Blueprint, many artists sought West out for beats similar to those he made for Jay-Z. While this did help West further his career, it wasn't quite what he wanted from music. He wanted to be at the forefront of his work; he wanted his name to be known as something more than just a production credit. He wanted fame, no matter what he had to go through.
    
    (Un)Luckily for West, he'd soon face one of the roughest parts of his life.
    
    In 2002, while West was driving home from a recording session, he fell asleep at the wheel, and had a head-on collision with another car. West was rushed to the hospital and received surgery, which required a metal plate to be put into his chin, and his mouth to be wired shut for a month. During his stay at the hospital, while laying in bed, West heard Chaka Khan's "Through the Fire," which would serve as his inspiration in overcoming his injuries.
    
    Only two weeks after his surgery, West had begun producing again, but this time, with his own voice as the main artist. Sampling the song that had helped him regain his footing, West released "Through the Wire," which - you guessed it - he performed while still having the wire in his mouth. Unbeknownst to some, Kanye had released this song first on his 2002 mixtape   Get Well Soon... , but it was later remastered. Having overcome his time as Chicago's underdog and a recovering patient, in 2004, West released his first album, titled   The College Dropout .
    
    But enough about West's history. Let's talk about the music.
    
    One of the defining parts of West's early work is his clever lyricism, an abundance of which you can find on this record. Some of my personal favorites include:
    
    "And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic // They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions" - "We Don't Care"
    
    "Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis" - "All Falls Down"
    
    "But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph // Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire" - "Through The Wire"
    
    And nearly every song on the album contains verses just as ingenious as these. But bars aren't all West has in store for this album. His flows also demonstrate his talent, such as his lines on "Get Em High," "Two Words," and "Last Call." However, unlike lyrics, flow isn't something you can capture in words, so I do encourage you to listen to this album to fully appreciate West's talent.
    
    West's production is another standout part of this album, as his signature "Chipmunk Soul" style shines through on most tracks on the album (that being, the style of chopping up soul samples and speeding them up.) While you can find lists of each song used in the production of the album online, my personal favorite was The Arc Choir's "Walk With Me," on "Jesus Walks." The way the low chant repeats throughout the track really makes you feel like you're walking with Kanye keeps the beat moving in a way that motivates the listener unlike any other song on the album.
    
    The College Dropout also focuses on themes that greatly diverge from those prevalent at the time in the rap genre, namely: Family, College/Education, and Religion. These changes in the typical themes of rap would eventually give an outlet of expression for rappers that didn't focus on gang culture and materialism (although the latter is somewhat present on this album as well… but discussed in a way that intersects with race issues.)
    
    West's scope of storytelling is limited to the song it's present on, but don't discredit it for this, as the stories themselves are still captivating. On "All Falls Down," West tells the story of a young college student who's struggling with her future and materialism, and relates this story to his own, in a self-conscious fashion. As the hypothetical woman struggles with her purpose in college and life, West talks about the expectations surrounding him, and how they ultimately reduce his character to his material worth. However, these lines also have another meaning, which talks about how society detracts black people’s worth.
    
    "Even if you in a Benz, you still a ***** in a coupe" - "All Falls Down"
    
    This is also supported later in the third verse, in which West goes further into society’s treatment of black people as well as how his rise to fame and success will help him overcome this.
    
    “‘Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth” - “All Falls Down”
    
    But this fear of materialism and institutionalized racism doesn't lead West to stray from rightfully bragging about his accomplishments, such as on "Two Words." After a feature from Mos Def, an artist West had produced for in his mixtape days, West's verse shows how proud he truly is. If there's one thing West promises to the listener on this track, it's that he plans to continue his rise to the top.
    
    "Plus, I got a whole city to hold down // From the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now." - "Two Words"
    
    All in all, The College Dropout is, at least in my opinion, one of the most influential Hip-Hop albums of the early 2000's. Not only did it mark the launch of West's career as a full-fledged producer-rapper, but the start of mainstream rap's shift away from the Gangsta rap genre. (a subject I'll return to on my review of Graduation.) West's motivation as a young artist erupts for all to see on this record, and continues flaring from beginning to end.
    
    Personally, I really enjoy coming back to this album every once in a while. While West's recent history has been... troubling... It's always nice to listen to good music. I don't think this is an album you necessarily need to listen to in order (as long as "Last Call" is last!), but it helps with overall flow of the album's themes. West's next album, released a little over a year later, on August 30th, 2005.
    
    If you're looking for something similar to this album, I recommend checking out Consequence's Take 'Em To The Cleaners, which was also produced by West around the same time. The album also features numerous features from West, so I'd recommend that if you're missing the dropout era.

        text: "With an eye for innovation and a mind for tech, club co-president Max Steele has shown me the true potential of STEM club. Collaborative projects and STEM competitions are the main foci of the club, as they say, and they want your support! Even if you are unfamiliar with STEM, there will be lessons along the way during every meeting to keep you in your most analytical state of mind. Don’t forget, everyone, we live in a world governed by STEM- and this is your best opportunity to break into it. I once loathed the very ideas of science and mathematics, but after seeing their first slideshow and witnessing the club’s opportunities, such as Lego Robotics competitions, I have become fascinated with the possibilities. The club meets during lunch: Tuesdays in Mr. Long’s room (3) and Thursdays in Mr. Hallsted’s room (6). Co-Presidents Max Steele and Rita Song, along with STEM Club’s officers are eager to have you collaborating with them on STEM’s projects.",

It has been a week since Bonding Day—the day where we come together on the field and do activities with students from different grades. Now that it’s over, we’ve had the chance to ask people their opinions of the event.\n
Sophomore Judah Nyquist didn’t have the most positive experience, stating: "Uhh, it sucked in my opinion. It was really hot and the games were boring. The trivia [game] was the only good part."\n
Other people had more complex opinions. Henry Rudriego, a sophomore, said, "I thought Bonding Day was pretty enjoyable. I feel like some of the activities were simple in their own right, but I feel that they were a little too complicated for the Bonding Day setting. Like the whole game where you have to find words and the water pong game—it wasn’t very engaging. I drifted off. I wasn’t really engaged that way, but a lot of the other games were pretty fun."\n
It seems like Bonding Day needs some improvement, but with a few fixes and better weather, it can become an even more enjoyable experience for all students.

        text: `
Max: What do you like to do?

Mr. Hallsted: You could say “all of the above.” Or, most of the above. Reading, playing video games, keeping active, hiking; hiking when people keep their dogs on leash or in leash-only areas, or at least have dogs that obey them and don’t randomly run up to strangers. I have opinions on who should and shouldn’t be dog owners.

Max: Tell me about what you like to read.

Mr. Hallsted: I mostly like to read fantasy and sci-fi. Jupiter by Ben Bova, The Legend of Drizzt Series, Hitchhiker’s Guide, Discworld, Kingkiller Chronicles, and Webtoon-wise, Greatest Estate Developer is one, A Spell for a Smith, Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, the Stellar Swordsman, 1 Second, The Re-Married Empress, The Age of Arrogance, and additional isekai comics.

Max: How about video games?

Mr. Hallsted: PokeRogue is my main one currently. The Mass Effect trilogy is my all-time favorite. The Portal and Portal 2, and the Portal Paint Gun Initiative, which is a fan made add-on, are also some of my favorites. Hades, Death must Die, Power Wash Sim, Balatro, Vampire Survivors, the Mist Series, and more.

Max: Would you say you’ve always been a gamer, or is this something newer.

Mr. Hallsted: I mean, one of my first memories is playing Pong on an Apple II. Another one of my first memories was my dad forgetting to pick me up from preschool because he was playing Diablo. He plays a lot of Pokemon Go nowadays.

Max: How do you keep active?

Mr. Hallsted: A lot of Beat Saber. I play levels where my hands travel 60 miles in a level. I’ll end up playing that for 2 hours. That might be both hands added together in a linear distance, so each hand might do 30 miles. I want to get back into running, I want to get back into paddle boarding, I want to learn how to roller skate.

Max: And how many games do you have on Steam?

Mr. Hallsted: I have exactly 800 games on the dot. I’ve had a Steam account for 14 years, so it accumulates. Prior to that, I was playing on my mom’s Steam account as well. I first played Fallout, Mass Effect, and stuff like that on my mom’s Steam account. She played games too; we played City of Heroes together. She currently plays World of Warcraft and Diablo 4. So, we be gamers.

Max: Do you have any siblings?

Mr. Hallsted: I have a younger sibling by 2 and a half years. He would always follow me around and I got tired of it, but for the most part we got along. He is also bigger than I am- taller and heavier, but at the same time, I am stronger.

Max: What kind of content do you like to watch?

Mr. Hallsted: Science and math content for a good portion, and then, I do watch a couple of gaming stuff as well. So the major channels are the Oddscast, which has been around since I was in high school, and Many a True Nerd, which has also been around since then but I had only found it in college. Those are the two gaming channels. Otherwise, Veritaseum, Stand up Maths, Numberphile, Three Blue one Brown, the various Minute science channels, ASAP Science, Backyard Scientist, Stuff Made Here- I’ve got a whole list.
