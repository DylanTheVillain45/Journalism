        text: "With an eye for innovation and a mind for tech, club co-president Max Steele has shown me the true potential of STEM club. Collaborative projects and STEM competitions are the main foci of the club, as they say, and they want your support! Even if you are unfamiliar with STEM, there will be lessons along the way during every meeting to keep you in your most analytical state of mind. Don’t forget, everyone, we live in a world governed by STEM- and this is your best opportunity to break into it. I once loathed the very ideas of science and mathematics, but after seeing their first slideshow and witnessing the club’s opportunities, such as Lego Robotics competitions, I have become fascinated with the possibilities. The club meets during lunch: Tuesdays in Mr. Long’s room (3) and Thursdays in Mr. Hallsted’s room (6). Co-Presidents Max Steele and Rita Song, along with STEM Club’s officers are eager to have you collaborating with them on STEM’s projects.",

It has been a week since Bonding Day—the day where we come together on the field and do activities with students from different grades. Now that it’s over, we’ve had the chance to ask people their opinions of the event.\n
Sophomore Judah Nyquist didn’t have the most positive experience, stating: "Uhh, it sucked in my opinion. It was really hot and the games were boring. The trivia [game] was the only good part."\n
Other people had more complex opinions. Henry Rudriego, a sophomore, said, "I thought Bonding Day was pretty enjoyable. I feel like some of the activities were simple in their own right, but I feel that they were a little too complicated for the Bonding Day setting. Like the whole game where you have to find words and the water pong game—it wasn’t very engaging. I drifted off. I wasn’t really engaged that way, but a lot of the other games were pretty fun."\n
It seems like Bonding Day needs some improvement, but with a few fixes and better weather, it can become an even more enjoyable experience for all students.
